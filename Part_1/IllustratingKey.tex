\part{Illustrating Key Ideas} \label{part:Key}
Adaptive algorithms use the intermediate results of their computations to make strategic choices on what to compute next and when to stop.  To discuss them clearly we must understand some key ideas: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the numerical problem that needs to be solved?
    
    \item What is the expected output from the algorithm? 
    
    \item How can we compare different algorithms? 
    
    \item How difficult is the problem?
    
    \item What sets of input functions are amenable to adaptive algorithms?
\end{itemize}  
We introduce these ideas with some relatively simple problems and algorithms in these chapters.
